## Technologies used :

## Technical overview :
* The system comprises three main user roles: Employee, Manager, and Administrator, each with distinct responsibilities.
Employees have the ability to add and view their task details, as well as access their profile information.
* Managers can access task details for all employees, view employee information, and categorize tasks into various types. Task categorization is a privilege exclusive to manager and administrator roles.
* Administrators, possessing the highest level of authority, can add users to the system and have full access to all data, similar to managers but with additional privileges and permissions.
